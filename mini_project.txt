Neural Networks are becoming more and more popular every day and as a core field of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, they are going to play a major role in technology, science and industry over the next years. This high popularity has given rise to many frameworks that allow you to implement Neural Networks very easily without knowing the complete theory behind them. On the other side, the strict theoretical explanation of neural network mechanisms demands some knowledge on high-level mathematics.  In this post, we will do something between. Specifically, in order to get a more solid understanding of neural networks, we will go through the actual implementation of a NN from scratch without using any framework, but we will omit the proofs for the sake of simplicity. This may be a bit more difficult than using a framework but you will gain a much better understanding of the mechanism behind the algorithm. Of course, in large scale projects a framework implementation is preferred as it is easier and faster to set up.
