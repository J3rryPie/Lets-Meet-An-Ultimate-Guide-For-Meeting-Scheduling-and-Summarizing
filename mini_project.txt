for your ears for years now the master of intrigueLatent Semantic Analysis is an unsupervised approach that uses the context of the input document and extracts information such as which words are used together and which common words are seen in different sentences. Singular Value Decomposition, an algebraic method, is used to find out the interrelations between sentences and words. SVD has the capability of noise reduction, which helps to improve accuracy. This approach requires three steps that are Input matrix creation, perform SVD and sentence selection. Advantage of LSA vectors over word vectors is that semantic relations as represented in the human brain are captured automatically by LSA vectors while word vectors require explicit methods to originate those semantic relations. TextRank is an extractive, unsupervised text summarization technique. It’s a graph-based ranking model for text processing which can be used in order to find the most relevant sentences in text and also to find keywords. and suspense reunites the unforgettable team of his smash bestseller the president's daughter to go after a unique and mysterious killer one by one members of the secret splinter group known as the sons of Aaron are being murdered the consequences are greater than anything realises for this actions lies the destruction of two governments And The Fall of the Irish peace process quickly quietly before all hell breaks loose but they are already too late for in the Manhattan Lai night silver haired woman smiling she pulls a gun from her purse and stepped into the Darkness 4:00 down she thinks only three to go the White House connection is a satisfying suspense field book a masterful job higgins is the consumed craftsman the White House connection is fast paced starting with the first page of book of the month club main selection will keep you turning the pages liking us today the White House connection
