This high popularity has given rise to many frameworks that allow you to implement Neural Networks very easily without knowing the complete theory behind them.Specifically, in order to get a more solid understanding of neural networks, we will go through the actual implementation of a NN from scratch without using any framework, but we will omit the proofs for the sake of simplicity.
